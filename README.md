# Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning
This project employs deep learning techniques to classify brain tumors based on MRI images. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), the system seeks to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis, aiding healthcare professionals by automating the classification process.

## Key Features
- MRI Image Classification: Uses CNN, LSTM, and DNN models to differentiate among types of brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors) and non-tumor images.
- Data Processing and Augmentation: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model training and accuracy.
- Model Optimization: Each model is tuned and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable performance in medical diagnostics.

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in medical imaging to support accurate, automated brain tumor classification.
